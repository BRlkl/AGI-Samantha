What it is:

An AI system that not only reacts, but acts. Thinking and behaving like a human.

How to use:

You communicate with the entity on the terminal while you can see its inner workings on the flask website.

How it works:

Works by orchestrating together multiple different GPT calls, "Modules", each one with a specific function of the human brain, running on loop.

How to improve:

Better results can continuously be achieved by tweaking which modules are present, the organization of the modules, and the prompt of the modules.
Think of a thing that the human mind can do that LLM "Cannot", then implement it, then test it. Easy to do and to iterate. The more that is done the closer it is going to be to the human mind.
